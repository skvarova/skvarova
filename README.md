- 👋 Hi, I’m Paulina 
- 👀 I’m interested in dietetics, TV series (crime, fantasy, horror), fantasy and crime movies, nail styling, and recently I have become interested in HTML, CSS and software testing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and software testing (XML, Soap UI, JIRA, SQL, Postman)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with companies that will allow me to gain my first professional experience as a manual tester
